## Installation
- Click the green "Code" button
- Click "Download ZIP"
- Take the folder from inside the .zip file and move it inside your Figura avatars folder
- Profit

## Customization
- Textures can be modified, although you may have to refresh them within Blockbench, I'm unsure.
- The sound can also be swapped out, but come on, it's too iconic.
