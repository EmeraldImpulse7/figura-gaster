## Features
- Magma Cube-like body animations.
- Keybind for turning eyes on. Plays "snd_mysterygo."
- Keybind for activating "Dapper-Gaster." Is saved using the `config` API.
  - [Inspired by this animation.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKJxIYve4QA)
- Custom death animation. Temporarily activates "Eyes On" mode with additional effects.

## Customization
- Textures can be modified, although you may have to refresh them within Blockbench, I'm unsure.
- The sound can also be swapped out, but come on, it's too iconic.
- Keybinds are modifiable via the figura menu.
