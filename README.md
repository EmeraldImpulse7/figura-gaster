# figura-gaster v2
A W.D. Gaster avatar for Figura.

## To-Do
- Add alternate textures (one more accurate to original source, herobrine themed one, maybe a skulk one?)
- Re-add custom death animation (make it look nicer and be less buggy)
- *Figura* out how the hell GitHub Actions works (in order to have proper automatic releases)

- Toggle for an outline.

## Customization
- Textures can be modified, although you may have to refresh them within Blockbench, I'm unsure.
- The sound can also be swapped out, but come on, it's too iconic.
